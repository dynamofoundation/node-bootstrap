# node-bootstrap

Block and chainstate files to fast-forward through the synchronization process of a node install.

Archive files are dated and time-stamped for when they are pulled.
For most node installs, the contained files would replace your blocks and chainstate directories within the .dynamo directory on Linux and %appdata%\dynamo on Windows.
